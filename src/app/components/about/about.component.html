  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a Java Backend Developer with 3.5+ years of experience building
    scalable microservices using Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux, and PostgreSQL.
  </p>
  <p>
    I specialize in automation workflows, multi-format data ingestion, incremental update engines,
    and clean backend architectures that are easy to maintain and extend.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve worked on GTM, TCM, and CDS systems where I built loaders, schedulers,
    reactive APIs, and high-performance data pipelines for real-world trade content.
